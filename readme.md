# IPL Data Analysis & Insights (2008–2019)

## Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) data from 2008 to 2019 to uncover meaningful insights about team performance, player impact, and match dynamics.  
The analysis supports team strengthening strategies, player selection, and brand endorsement decisions using data-driven insights.
